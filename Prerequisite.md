## Prerequisite

Before you can start this course you need to have **Java** installed on your computer 
and have an available **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment).

For the purpose of this course we will use [Open JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)
and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

> If you already have this setup you can skip the steps below.

#### 1. Install Open JDK

We recommend that you install the latest LTE (long term support) version of Java 
(as of the time of writing this is Java 11).

You can download and install the appropriate JDK for your operating system from 
[here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html).

##### Verify Java is installed

To make sure that Java is properly installed open a terminal (if you are running Windows open CMD)
and type `java -version` and press `â†µ Enter`.

You should see something like this:
```
openjdk version "11" 2018-09-25
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11+28)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11+28, mixed mode)
```

If you do not get the output above then Java is not configured properly.
Read how to set up **JAVA_HOME** and the **PATH** variable.


#### 2. Install IntelliJ IDEA

You can install the free **Community** version of IntelliJ. You can download it 
[here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Make sure you download the correct distribution
for your operating system.


#### 3. Create a Gitlab account

For this course we will be using [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) to store and review our code.
